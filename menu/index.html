            <h2>About this Website</h2>
            <p>The Everything-Generator is a collection of poorly written Random-Generators, inspired by Random-Generators that has been around for years.</p>
            <p>Ever needed to quickly generate a list of random objects? Well, this website is perfect for you. (Maybe?)</p>
            <p>I'm not gonna lie, I have no idea what this is supposed to be, but I hope it has some useful stuff</p>

            <p>This website is made Computer first. I will try to fix any issues that arise on</p>

            <p>My apologies!</p>
